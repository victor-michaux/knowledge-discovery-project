SpaceX has re-flown used first stages many times, but today's launch marked the first time a booster had ever propelled payloads to orbit on three separate occasions. The success is therefore an important milestone for SpaceX, which aims to fly all its vehicles repeatedly and frequently. Such rapid reuse could slash the cost of spaceflight, opening the heavens to exploration, company founder and CEO Elon Musk has said. [Launch Photos: SpaceX Falcon 9 Lofts 64 Satellites (and Lands) on Historic 3rd Flight]And this particular first stage could conceivably fly yet again. The booster stuck its landing today, touching down softly about 8 minutes after liftoff on the SpaceX drone ship "Just Read the Instructions," which was stationed in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX also attempted to catch the rocket's payload fairing — the protective nose cone that surrounds satellites during launch — today with its net-equipped boat, Mr. Steven. (Falcon 9 fairings fall back to Earth in two pieces, each under parachute.) The attempt is unsuccessful, as Mr. Steven's several prior tries have also been. But SpaceX still plans to reuse the fairing, which cost about $6 million to manufacture, Musk said via Twitter today."Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr. Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim," Musk tweeted.A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Dec. 3, 2018, carrying 64 satellites to orbit on the SSO-A: Smallsat Express mission.

But where is that asteroid and its visiting spacecraft, which is now two years into its journey? Although it's easy to assume that an asteroid mission would target the asteroid belt, Bennu isn't tucked in this rocky region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.Instead, Bennu's orbit waltzes between those of Earth and of Mars, averaging around 100 million miles (160 million kilometers) away from the sun. That makes it a near-Earth asteroid, like the one Japan's Hayabusa-2 mission is currently studying.

Last year, more than 771 million people passed through airport security nationwide. Among the liquids and wrapped presents Transportation Security Administration agents unearth in passengers’ carry-ons, they’re finding more and more firearms.From 2015 to 2017, the TSA found at least 9,866 firearms in carry-on baggage at airports nationwide.Unlike laptops or liquids under three ounces, firearms are listed on TSA’s prohibited items list, meaning like aerosol containers and lighters, they’re not allowed in the cabin, and can only be packed in a checked bag.According to Guns & America’s analysis of data released by TSA, the number of guns found at airport security checkpoints has grown. The TSA found 3,896 guns at airports across the country in 2017 — 49 percent more guns than the 2,608 guns found in 2015.More than 85 percent of these guns were loaded and more than 3 in 10 firearms found were “round-chambered” and ready to shoot.The analysis of TSA data paints a picture of the firearms floating around our communities every day. Many of the guns found at airport security were left in the bottom of bags or in purses, forgotten until their owner slid their carry-on bag through screening equipment.

Carrying a gun through a TSA checkpoint is illegal. But due to the growth in state-issued concealed carry permits, many jurisdictions let permit-holders carry loaded firearms on their person or in a bag“They don’t think twice about it,” said Jeff Price, a former assistant security director at Denver International Airport. “They think ‘I have a permit,’ and that permit I know is good across state lines. They don’t think that does not apply on an airplane.”courtesy of TSAThe collage above includes images of the guns TSA found in carry-on bags across the country in 2017. According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit organization, more than 17.2 million people have concealed handgun permits in 2018, up more than 5 percent since 2017.“It’s hard to speculate,” said TSA spokeswoman Carrie Harmon. “Most passengers say that they forgot their firearm was in their carry-on bag. We want to remind people, you need to check your bags when you pack them.”

One of the most pressing questions about American politics – and the most baffling one to people from other countries – is why politicians have failed to act in the face of mounting gun violence.That conundrum becomes even more puzzling when you consider how strong public support for gun control actually is. There is overwhelming support (67 per cent and higher) for banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, creating a gun-sales database, and requiring background checks for all gun sales.Yet the last time Congress passed a gun-control law was 1994 – nearly a quarter-century ago.Responsibility for that failure to act rests with the NRA and the Republican Party, which have become twin entities since 1994.Prior to the passage of gun reform in the early 1990s, the NRA was bipartisan in its giving. For the 1992 election, it gave about a third of its donations to Democrats and the rest to Republicans. Today, the split is 1 per cent for Democratic candidates, 99 per cent for the GOP.

I first shot a handgun when I was 5 or 6 years old. I’m not sure which — I wasn’t good at counting yet.It was a .45-caliber, like the gun the shooter at the Borderline Bar & Grill used Nov. 7 to kill 12 people and then himself in Thousand Oaks. I remember it felt heavy and important and powerful. Because I could barely hold it straight, I hit the target because of — not in spite of — the kickback, which was like holding a thundercloud.I liked it immediately. I still do. But liking a thing, while an important aspect of public policy, isn’t enough. We have to weigh the benefits of liking something against its costs. And the costs of guns are heavy and important and powerful, too.It is worth saying this: The evidence that restricting gun ownership reduces crime overall is mixed at best. The evidence that it reduces mass shootings is better but not airtight. And indeed, guns per capita have risen much, much faster in the United States than gun crimes per capita.But if we look at all deaths, not just criminal deaths, guns do kill. They kill mostly through suicide, but they kill all the same. And although that death toll is heavier than the 13 people lost Nov. 7, it is much harder for us to see.The founders of our nation were wise to worry about the encroachment of national power on the states, and of foreign powers upon the nation, which is why we have a right to bear arms. And for some people, the existence of the Second Amendment precludes a discussion of costs and benefits and restrictions.But even a cursory review of state laws at the time of the Bill of Rights, or of the Federalist Papers (the best CliffsNotes to our Constitution ever written), demonstrates that our current understanding of the right to bear arms is very different than the understanding of the founders. The restrictions they were willing to place were much more substantial than many gun rights advocates’ positions.After the last mass shooting (or maybe the one before that — it’s hard to keep them straight now, isn’t it?), I had a friend tell me how we should have less gun ownership. I wanted to show her how guns, the guns I like, are just a tool. They are neither good nor bad, just an object.So I took her shooting. We went to a range in Oxnard. I showed her how to hold a pistol, how to aim. She shot one round. Then five. Then a 10-round clip from a .22-caliber target pistol.She did a decent job of hitting the target. I thought she’d be excited. But when she set down the gun and turned toward me, she looked horrified.“It’s so easy,” she said to me. “It’s just ... it’s too damn easy.”I like guns. I still do. But it’s the morning after the Borderline shooting as I write this, and I’m supposed to be grading exams, and instead I’m waiting for emails from each of my students confirming that they’re alive.And so you’ll pardon me, despite my usual libertarian leanings, but I hope the new Congress will at least attempt to make it slightly harder to own guns in our country. Because how those students did on their exams — not whether or not they were shot to death — should be the heaviest and most important thing they have to deal with right now.Jared Barton is program chair and an associate professor of economics at CSU Channel Islands.

BHUBANESWAR: Players and coaching staff of England Hockey team displayed their game skills in front of schoolchildren here on Wednesday. The England team, which is in the Capital to participate in the ongoing Odisha Hockey Men’s World Cup, paid a visit to Sai International School here and played hockey with the students. The players discussed both the game and their training methods with the kids. They also gave invaluable tips to the young players on the hit, push, flick, slap and backhand strokes. On the occasion, the school authorities organised a quiz competition for the students. Head of Mission, British Deputy High Commission Kolkata Shahida Khan thanked the England team for taking out time from their busy schedule to meet with young fans. ‘There is much enthusiasm in Odisha about the Hockey World Cup. I am sure this interaction with England Hockey players will make the students more confident about themselves and their game.It’s also great to see local support for the England team,” Shahida said. Performance Director of England Hockey Dr Ed Barney said the England team is eager to enjoy the local culture of Odisha and relish every moment during their stay in the State. Barney said visiting to the school has given the players and staff an opportunity to see Bhubaneswar, learn more about local culture and share some insights about England and the life as an International hockey player.

With a population of a little over 200,000, Terrassa is probably smaller than many Indian suburbs. But in this city in Catalonia, about one in every 2,000 persons is a hockey Olympian.When one talks of hockey cradles, Sansarpur, Gojra or Rotterdam are some of the cities that immediately come to mind. But Terrassa remains an under-rated, almost unheard of, nursery of the modern game. The city has produced 125 hockey Olympians since the sport made its debut at the Games in 1928.In fact, one-third of the Spanish team here for the World Cup is from Terrassa – Marc Bolto, Pau Quemada, Pepe Romeu, Quico Cortes, Vicenc Ruiz and Miguel Delas. Several more play club hockey in the city. “Spanish hockey is because of Terrassa. It breathes hockey. a perfect hockey town,” says Spain coach Frederic Soyez.A hockey town not by accident, but design. And it began with a cultural exchange programme between the English and Spaniards.

The clubs, in that sense, have contributed greatly to Terrassa’s legacy. Atletic Terrassa, Club Egara, Club Deportio Terrassa all have rich histories and have won multiple domestic titles among them. Atletic, founded in 1952, has won the Spanish league a record 21 times, apart from two continental titles. Earlier this year, they were named European Hockey Federation’s Club of the Year.Delas says players from Terrassa are unique because of their skill set. Spain has three traditional hockey hotbeds — Barcelona, Madrid and Terrassa. While Barcelona and Madrid have players much more in sync with the European style, the players from Terrassa are famous for their deftness, visible in the way they have played here — calm with the ball and unafraid of showing their individual skills.“They are skillful because they have a lot of players and get good coaching since childhood. So players from here have confidence, which they bring from their club to the national team,” Delas, who picked up an injury and was ruled out of the World Cup two days ago, says.When Barcelona hosted the Olympics in 1992, the hockey matches were played 20km away in Terrassa. Now, they have set their sights on the next World Cup. “To celebrate 30 years of Barcelona hosting the Olympic Games, we want to host the next World Cup in 2022 in Terressa,” former International Hockey Federation president Leandro Negre says. “It is a special place to host the event.”

When Paul Stewart was just a kid, he went everywhere with his Dad, Bill Stewart Jr., as he refereed football, baseball and hockey all over the Northeast. That helped Paul develop a love of sports … especially hockey. But his family wasn’t wealthy.Paul Stewart and his father, Bill Stewart Jr., on the baseball field in the late 1950s. (Courtesy Paul Stewart)Paul Stewart and his father, Bill Stewart Jr., on the baseball field in the late 1950s. (Courtesy Paul Stewart)"Longingly, I waited for my own pair of skates," Stewart says. "And I didn’t know we weren’t rich."But in 1959, Bill Stewart stretched the family budget and bought Paul his first pair of hockey skates. They helped Paul parlay his hockey skills into a short pro career.From Hockey Player To RefereePaul Stewart’s stats from his final season tell you pretty much all you need to know about the kind of player he was. In 21 games with the 1979–80 Quebec Nordiques, he scored two goals and racked up 74 penalty minutes.But Paul Stewart would go on to make a bigger name for himself as a well-respected NHL referee from 1986 to 2003. He became the first American to officiate more than 1,000 games. Sometimes, his job brought him to Boston, where his Dad, Bill Stewart, had taught and coached three sports at Boston English High School. When Paul visited, they’d watch Star Trek together."And he’d elbow me a little bit and say, 'Now there’s an English High boy that did well for himself,' " Stewart says.The boy in question was Leonard Nimoy.Long before he grew the pointy ears, Nimoy was a student of Stewart’s. “Cool,” Paul Stewart thought. “My Dad taught Mr. Spock."

THE GAP BETWEEN Windows 7 and Windows 10 use on traditional desktops and laptops continues to narrow, despite the fact that both operating systems lost a small amount of ground this month in the figures produced by Netmarketshare.Windows 7 drops to 38.89 per cent (-0.46) with Windows 10 continuing to snap at its heels at 38.14 (-0.14), meaning that the difference is now just 0.75 per cent, which suggests that Microsoft is still on target to finally overtake itself before the year is out. Just. Possibly.Windows 8.x is now 5.52 per cent (-0.29), with the vast majority on version 8.1. Windows XP has a slight bounce to 4.23 (+0.63).We've stopped mentioning Vista now, such is its rarity.Although the figures from Netmarketshare have a margin of error (or put another way, we take them with a slight pinch of salt) the fact that Windows 10 hasn't grown as a result of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which both fell in this period is a bit of a curveball - in fact most of the movement has been on the Apple front in the wake of its new Macbook Air made of old tin cans and string.As you'd expect, the latest version, macOS 10.14 has seen the biggest gains of the month standing at 3.57 (+1.52), though the rate of upgrade has been slow by Mac user standards, macOS 10.13 has dropped to 3.2 (-1.43) but it hasn't been the usual swift handover. Even macOS 10.12 still has 1.36 (-0.22) and macOS 10.11 has 1.14 (0.23) which is actually a slight rise.The Linux-based systems continue to hover around the same point - Ubuntu on 0.57 (-0.05), Chrome OS on 0.32 (-0.01) and the rest on 1.47 (0.09). Worth noting there are more people using Mac OS X 10.10 and "Unknown" than Chrome OS right now - though it still has the lead in the browser market.When we remove the filter and look at market share amongst all device types - that is to say any device that has connected to the internet during November, the story changes.Window 7 (which, lest we forget is almost exclusively desktop/laptop machine anyway) is the most popular operating system in the world with 16.08 per cent. Windows 10 comes second with 15.77 and Android 8.0 has 8.62.Generically though, Android is in the lead - 39.34 per cent. Windows stands at 35.98. iOS has 18.51 per cent and Mac OS, 4.02. Linux has 0.88 and despite its popularity is schools, Chrome OS has 0.13.For completeness, below them is Series 40 (Symbian) at 0.04, Windows Phone OS at 0.03 and RIM OS (Blackberry) at just 0.01 per cent market share.

very intense PC user knows the importance of owning multiple monitors instead of one. Be it gaming, graphics editing or coding — a multi-monitor setup in Windows 10 booms productivity by a great deal.Having two or more screens by your side can help in different ways. For example, you can use multiple desktop tabs efficiently. Watching multimedia content on multiple monitor setup also makes the overall experience more appealing.In this article, I will explain to you how to set up a second monitor for Windows 10. Once you get familiar with setting up a dual screen, you won’t face problems dealing with a multi monitor setup.charanjeet Singh04/12/2018YANGON: Myanmar’s Minister for Religion on Tuesday (Dec 4) said Rohingya Muslim refugees living in neighbouring Bangladesh are being "brainwashed" into "marching" on the Buddhist-majority nation, amid a diplomatic feud over the fate of the persecuted minority.More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in the wake of a brutal army crackdown last August, UN agencies say, and are now living in crowded Bangladeshi refugee camps. UN investigators have accused Myanmar soldiers of carrying out mass killings, rapes and burning hundreds of villages with "genocidal intent". Myanmar denies most of the allegations.Thura Aung Ko said Bangladesh was "not letting them return", referring to the Rohingya as "Bengalis", a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply that they are recent interlopers from Bangladesh. Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state."If release them, the population will drop," he said in a video shared by NewsWatch, a news website. "And then, they, at the camps, also feed and brainwash Bengali youths to truly march. They will march on Myanmar. The future goal of those over populated Bengalis is to march on Myanmar."Plans to repatriate an initial group of 2,260 Rohingya from the camps last month were scuppered after none of the refugees agreed to go back, saying they wanted guarantees of safety and citizenship.Thura Aung Ko, a former general who was appointed to the cabinet by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi after she came to power in 2016, was expanding on comments he made at the funeral of a prominent monk last week. On Nov 27, he expounded on birth rates among members of an unnamed "extreme religion" and the threat it posed to Buddhism in Myanmar."While we Buddhists practise monogamy and have only one or two children, an extreme religion encourages to have three or four wives and give birth to 15 to 20 children," he said in a video published by Radio Free Asia. "After three, four, five decades in this Buddhist country, the Buddhist community will certainly become the minority."On Tuesday, he clarified: "In fact, ‘other religion’ means Bengalis."San Aung, the chairman of an Islamic society based in Yangon, said by phone the comments were "very sad"."As a minister for religion he shouldn’t speak irresponsibly," he said.

Ethical veganism could be given the status of a religion in a landmark employment tribunal, as experts have said “it is more than just a lifestyle choice”.Jordi Casamitjana, an ethical vegan, has claimed that he was fired by the League Against Cruel Sports after raising concerns that its pension fund was being invested into companies involved in animal testing.He has said that he was unfairly disciplined for making the disclosure and that the charity’s decision to dismiss him was because of his philosophical belief in ethical veganism.Unlike dietary vegans who just eat a plant-based diet, ethical vegans exclude all forms of animal exploitation by not wearing clothes made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals.Mr Casamitjana's lawyers said ethical veganism "comfortably" satisfies the series of tests required for it to be classed as a philosophical or religious belief, meaning it would be protected under the Equality Act 2010.These tests include being worthy of respect in a democratic society, not being incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with fundamental rights of others.Acting on behalf of Mr Casamitjana, Bindmans LLP solicitor Peter Daly said: "Ethical veganism is more than simply a dietary choice."It is a particular and well-defined philosophical view about the relationship between humans and animals. It is based on well-considered and substantial philosophical thinking."Dr Suzanne Owen, a reader of religious studies at Leeds Trinity University, supported the argument and said Mr Casamitjana “has a very strong case.”Dr Owen, who assisted members of the Druid Network in 2010 when they successfully argued that they were a religion to the Charity Commission, said: “Veganism can be coherently presented as a belief, because of the ethical dimension that Mr Casamitjana can, and probably will, articulate.

Servers host applications, manage files, process emails, stream media and perform analytics. Any organization can benefit from the power and versatility that servers provide, but it can be difficult to know which types of server hardware to choose.Today's servers are primarily available in three forms: racks, blades and mainframes. The majority of IT teams turn to rack and blade servers to meet their server requirements. Some teams opt for mainframe computers to handle their workloads, although not nearly to the extent of rack and blade servers.Rack, blade and mainframe servers all have their advantages and disadvantages, and buyers should carefully weigh these different types of server hardware before deciding on a product. Buyers do not need to limit their selection to any one type, however. Organizations can choose what's best for the workloads they need to support with an eye on budget and space constraints.What is a server?A server is a type of computer that provides processing and memory resources for different workloads. The term server can refer to the computer itself or to a program that delivers a service, such as an email management system. Most hardware-related references concern the physical machine. The server operating system (OS) is designed to process large workloads, deliver services and support network-based operations. Common server OSes include Linux, Unix and Windows Server.Servers are usually set up to provide one or more specific services. Servers are commonly used to manage network resources and make them available to client devices. A server is often referenced to based on the purpose it serves. For example, a print server provides network users with access to shared printers, and a media server streams video and audio content to network users.A server's physical configuration is usually specific to the types of services it provides. For example, a database server might include more processing or memory resources to handle the influx of concurrent transactions. Many data centers also implement server virtualization to deliver services more efficiently. Server virtualization can help better utilize the server's physical resources, while also increasing flexibility and security and reducing energy consumption.

Today’s topics include AWS bringing its cloud hardware on premises with AWS Outposts, and Dell resetting user passwords after a website attack.Amazon Web Services unveiled its AWS Outposts initiative at its re:Invent conference last week, in response to businesses telling the company they want their on-premises systems to be an extension of their AWS or VMware Cloud in AWS, with the same hardware, APIs and interfaces.AWS Outposts initially will come in two flavors. One will enable customers to run VMware Cloud on AWS locally in their own data centers, allowing them to use the same VMware control plane and APIs that they’ve been using for their own infrastructures.The other option is for organizations that want the same APIs and control plane they’ve used in the AWS cloud. This offering will include the new, integrated VMware solution called VMware Cloud Foundation for EC2, which includes VMware technologies like NSX for network virtualization and AppDefense that can work across VMware and Amazon EC2 environments.AWS to Bring Its Cloud Hardware On-PremisesDell Discloses Attack Against Its WebsiteAWS will deliver the racks of servers and storage to customers and can install, manage and maintain them. Outposts are in private preview and will be generally available in the second half of 2019.Dell announced on Nov. 28 that its Dell.com customer-facing website was the victim of a cyber-attack discovered on Nov. 9, with attackers taking aim at usernames, email addresses and passwords that had been cryptographically hashed. Dell has no evidence that customer information was actually removed from the site.Dell noted that credit card information was not targeted and there was no direct impact on Dell's products or services. The company also announced it has initiated a mandatory password reset for all of its Dell.com users to further mitigate any potential risk.

(Reuters) - NASA’s deep space explorer Osiris-Rex flew on Monday to within a dozen miles of its destination, a skyscraper-sized asteroid believed to hold organic compounds fundamental to life as well as the potential to collide with Earth in about 150 years. Launched in September 2016, Osiris-Rex embarked on NASA’s unprecedented seven-year mission to conduct a close-up survey of the asteroid Bennu, collect a sample from its surface and return that material to Earth for study.Bennu, a rocky mass roughly a third of a mile wide and shaped like a giant acorn, orbits the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth and is thought to be rich in carbon-based organic molecules dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. Water, another vital component to the evolution of life, may also be trapped in the asteroid’s minerals.Scientists believe that asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered organic compounds and water that seeded the planet for life, and atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help prove that theory.Scientists estimate there is a one-in-2,700 chance of the asteroid slamming catastrophically into Earth 166 years from now. That probability ranks Bennu No. 2 on NASA’s catalog of 72 near-Earth objects potentially capable of hitting the planet.Osiris-Rex will help scientists understand how heat radiated from the sun is gently steering Bennu on an increasingly menacing course through the solar system. That solar energy is believed to be nudging the asteroid ever closer toward Earth’s path each time the asteroid makes its closest approach to our planet every six years.FILE PHOTO - NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft is seen on display at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, U.S. August 20, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Brown“By the time we collect the sample in 2020 we will have a much better idea of the probability that Bennu would impact Earth in the next 150 years,” mission spokeswoman Erin Morton said.Scientists have estimated that in 2135 Bennu could pass closer to Earth than the moon, which orbits at a distance of about 250,000 miles, and possibly come closer still some time between 2175 and 2195.Osiris-Rex reached the “preliminary survey” phase of its mission on Monday, soaring to within 12 miles of the asteroid. The spacecraft will pass just 1.2 miles from Bennu in late December, where it will enter the object’s gravitational pull.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday put restrictions on police searches of vehicles for the second time this month, ruling in a Virginia case involving a stolen motorcycle that officers generally cannot search a vehicle on private property without a warrant.Police officers stand in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, DC, U.S., January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo The 8-1 decision called into question evidence police obtained from a motorcycle search that was used to convict defendant Ryan Collins of receiving stolen property. The case will return to lower courts to determine if the police had other lawful grounds for entering the property without a court-approved warrant.The stolen motorcycle was covered by a tarpaulin and parked on private property next to a house in Charlottesville, Virginia.The Supreme Court in another ruling on May 14 limited the ability of police to search rental cars driven by someone other than the person who signed the rental agreement.At issue in Tuesday’s ruling was whether police violated the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, by failing to obtain a warrant before conducting the search.Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote on behalf of the court that Supreme Court precedent that says warrants are not always required for a vehicle search does not extend to vehicles parked outside a house on private property. Warrants are generally required for the search of a house and the immediate surrounding property, called “curtilage” in legal terminology.Sotomayor wrote that “searching a vehicle parked in the curtilage involves not only the invasion of the Fourth Amendment interest in the vehicle but also an invasion of the sanctity of the curtilage.”
